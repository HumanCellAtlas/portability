        Run a workflow, this endpoint will allow you to create a new workflow request and
        retrieve its tracking ID to monitor its progress.  An important assumption in this
        endpoint is that the workflow_params JSON will include parameterizations along with
        input and output files.  The latter two may be on S3, Google object storage, local filesystems,
        etc.  This specification makes no distinction.  However, it is assumed that the submitter
        is using URLs that this system both understands and can access. For Amazon S3, this could
        be accomplished by given the credentials associated with a WES service access to a
        particular bucket.  The details are important for a production system and user on-boarding
        but outside the scope of this spec.

      - UNKNOWN: The state of the task is unknown.

      This provides a safe default for messages where this field is missing,
      for example, so that a missing field does not accidentally imply that
      the state is QUEUED.
       - QUEUED: The task is queued.
       - INITIALIZING: The task has been assigned to a worker and is currently preparing to run.
      For example, the worker may be turning on, downloading input files, etc.
       - RUNNING: The task is running. Input files are downloaded and the first Executor
      has been started.
       - PAUSED: The task is paused.

      An implementation may have the ability to pause a task, but this is not required.
       - COMPLETE: The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error
      and output files have been successfully uploaded.
       - EXECUTOR_ERROR: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,
      this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.
       - SYSTEM_ERROR: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,
      for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out
      of disk space, etc.
       - CANCELED: The task was canceled by the user.

          The workflow CWL or WDL document, must provide either this or workflow_url. By combining
          this message with a workflow_type_version offered in ServiceInfo, one can initialize
          CWL, WDL, or a base64 encoded gzip of the required workflow descriptors. When files must be
          created in this way, the `workflow_url` should be set to the path of the main
          workflow descriptor.

      workflow_url:

          OPTIONAL
          The workflow CWL or WDL document, must provide either this or workflow_descriptor. When a base64 encoded gzip of
          workflow descriptor files is offered, the `workflow_url` should be set to the relative path
          of the main workflow descriptor.
